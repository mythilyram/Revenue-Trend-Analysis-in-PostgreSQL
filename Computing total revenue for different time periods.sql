Welcome
  
Hello and welcome to our PostgreSQL Revenue Trend Analysis course!
  This course is aimed for students from various industries who would like to use PostgreSQL to analyze revenue trends for their companies. 
  Once you learn how to analyze revenue, you'll also be able to analyze other trends, such as website visits over time, in a similar way.

Revenue is the income generated from the sale of products (or services, if that's what your company is selling), before any costs or expenses are deducted. 
  It is sometimes called sales or (in the UK) turnover. To determine net income you subtract all charges, costs, and expenses from the revenue.

Revenue is the most important figure in a financial statement for a company. In this course we'll look at various revenue metrics and we'll learn how to compute them in SQL.

SQL Basics - JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and HAVING clauses â€“ all of which you'll need for this course.

First, we'll get to know the database we're going to work with.

The Northwind database
We'll be using a Microsoft database named Northwind. 
  It describes a fictional store, its customers, and its orders. The original database is available here. 
  We've modified it a bit to better suit the needs of this course.
